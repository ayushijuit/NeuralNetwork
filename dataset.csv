1,"A problem in search box functionality is noted, which puts search suggestion entries above the divider separating them from previous matching searches.
This is happening because the incorrect data structure is being passed to the form history, which contains both form history and search suggest entries. As the results change as the user types in the search box, this allows suggestions to leak into the form history, resulting in the separator appearing to be in the wrong place.
An incomplete patch is offered, but the system needs to be smarter about throwing away previous results.
It turns out there are .formHistoryResult fields in two data structures, one of which needs to be discarded.
It is suggested and accepted that one should be renamed for clarity.
","MattN noticed a problem with the WIP patch from bug 469443 applied.When typing in the search box, sometimes search-suggestion entries would be displayed above the divider (where entries for previous matching searches are).The problem here is that nsSearchSuggestions.js is passing the wrong previousResult to form history. Instead of it being the previous form history search result, it's the SuggestAutoCompleteResult result (which contains the union of the form-history and search-suggest entries). So, when form history refines its results as you time, it can actually add *more* entries as data leaks from the suggestions result into form history result, and it thus looks like the divider is being drawn in the wrong place. This bug wasn't visible before 469443, because nsFormFillController::StartSearch tries to QI the provided result to a nsIAutoCompleteSimpleResult. The search-suggestion result is only implements nsIAutoCompletResult (no \""Simple\""), so the QI fails, historyResult nee previousResult becomes null, and thus Satchel was doing a new search every time. form history finds 1 entry (\""blah\""), search-suggestions finds \""baaa\"", \""bloop\"", \""bzzz\"", the autocompete menu shows these in order with a divider between \""blah\"" and \""baaa\"". startHistorySearch()'s previous result contains [\""blah\"", \""baaa\"", \""bloop\"", \""bzzz\""], Satchel filters this down to [\""blah\"", \""bloop\""] to match the new \""bl\"" search string nsSearchSuggestions's onReadyState() change is called with updated search suggestions, builds up a new list of results, but sees that the form history result now has *two* entries. Created an attachment (id=380567) [details] Patch v.1 (WIP) This fixes the problem, but isn't quite correct... If you type \""a&lt;backspace&gt;b\"", satchel trying to use the results from the \""a\"" search for the \""b\"" search, and so nothing is found. I suspect nsSearchSuggestions needs to throw away the old form history result when the search string changes like this, but I'm not entirely sure it's responsible for doing so, maybe satchel should be smarter about throwing away a previous result when the previous result's search string doesn't have a common prefix. That seems to be handled somewhere else for normal form field entries, oddly enough. Created an attachment (id=383211) [details] Patch v.2 Ah. So, there's a ._formHistoryResult in the SuggestAutoCompleteResult wrapper (used to combine form history with search suggestions), and also a ._formHistoryResult in  SuggestAutoComplete (the service itself, used to hold onto a form history result until a search suggestion is available).The simple fix it to just discard the service's form history result copy when startSearch() is called with a null previous result. Otherwise it's trying to use a old form history result that no longer applies for the search string. (From update of attachment 383211 [details]). Perhaps we should rename one of them to _fhResult just to reduce confusion? &gt; (From update of attachment 383211 [details] [details]) &gt; Perhaps we should rename one of them to _fhResult just to reduce confusion? Good point. I renamed the one in the wrapper to _formHistResult. fhResult seemed maybe a bit too short.Pushed http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/097598383614"
2,"It is suggested to remove the preference that removes the session storing feature, because disabling it breaks some features. It was originally intended for extensions to disable when they do their own session restore, but can leave users with it still disabled after the extension is disabled. Instead the extension writers should extend the API to do session restoration themselves. Those users concerned with the privacy implications can disable other settings to effectively to the same thing.","That pref was thought to be for extensions which wanted to completely replace our own Session Restore functionality. While this has worked somehow for Tab Mix Plus, we've had several issues with people ending up both Session Restore and Tab Mix Plus disabled (see bug 435055 and its duplicates).
Furthermore, there are several code points which will also break when Session Restore has been disabled (such as the list of recently closed tabs). Instead of adding try-catch-blocks wherever we use Session Restore, I'd much rather encourage extensions authors to override both nsSessionStartup and nsSessionStore to provide the same API with their own functionality (or implementing a dummy-API and making sure for themselves that they've correctly replaced all known consumers). This would also make the lives of those other extension authors simpler who so far can't be too sure that the Session Store component actually works (through whatever implementation). Note that privacy concerned users will still be able to disable writing to sessionstore.js through the browser.sessionstore.resume_from_crash pref. Created an attachment (id=332726) [details]. Remove the pref (note: bug 448725 should be wont fixed if this is fixed). Created an attachment (id=333820) [details]. Remove (buggy) note from API comments.  (From update of attachment 332726 [details]) , a problem with this patch is that the session data is still stored in memory while the app is running, and by removing this pref, there's no way to disable that. some users do not want the recently-closed-tabs menu, and others don't want any session tracks stored in memory at all. &gt; some users do not want the recently-closed-tabs menu, That's what browser.sessionstore.max_tabs_undo is for: setting it to 0 effectively disables the feature. &gt; and others don't want any session tracks stored in memory at all.

I'd rather introduce a different pref or different means to cater the privacy sensitive users than have this half-baked cut-it-all pref which AFAICT so far has produced more issues than it's solved. &gt; Then again, we don't save any data that wouldn't be in memory, anyway, or do we?

Care to convince mconnor that he's wrong? ;-) Pushed as 17120:e712e96d7861 and 17121:adb1ef78dd21. One men: This patch significantly affects Tab Mix Plus: Instead of disabling SessionStore, you'll now have to replace it by shipping a component which implements the same API. You should be able to keep that component minimal, though, and just call your own code whenever the API is used. This will make the lives of people using the SessionStore API (such as Session Manager) somewhat simpler, as they can just use the API without having to worry too much about the implementation behind it. If you want to offer the option of switching between your and our implementation, see e.g. the ignore-history component of the Torbutton extension for how to overwrite a component with the original still being available internally (so that you can either pass API calls forward or handle them yourself). Sounds like this has impact for extension authors and so should be documented on MDC no problem. current Tabmix dev-build already not disable SessionStore. I currently have only one problem , how to disable the restore after restart. can you add a pref for this, or some other way to do it? &gt; I currently have only one problem , how to disable the restore after restart. You've got several options for that:* Set the prefs browser.sessionstore.resume_from_crash and browser.sessionstore.resume_session_once both to false as early as possible and make sure that browser.startup.page isn't 3. * Delete the file sessionstore.js as early as possible (e.g. when the profile-after-change notification is dispatched).* For Firefox 3.1: Respond to the sessionstore-state-read notification by setting the subject's data member to an empty string (cf. bug 448741 comment#6).Or is there a use case I'm missing?

3,"There is a rotate gesture in Firefox that is often triggered accidentally while scrolling. It is agreed that the rotate should be removed in Windows and OSX in the next version of Firefox. It is suggested that the pinching gesture be removed as well, but it is decided that that should be in a separate thread.","I've noticed that I frequently trigger the rotate gesture accidentally, usually while scrolling.Gestures have improved since the original landing (when triggering the wrong gesture was really easy), but this articular gesture is still problematic. The basic reasoning is that it's highly disruptive to be switched to another tab when you're not expecting it. When it happens, you don't know what just happened until you notice that you're on some entirely different page, that's randomly to the left or right (1 or more tabs) from the page you thought you were on. I'm don't think the rotate gesture for switching tabs is nearly as useful, discoverable, or a good fit as the other gestures are So, given this problem, we should just disable it for 3.5.[I'd also be open to tweaking it to make it much harder to trigger accidentally, dunno if that's possible.] See also bug 461376.Just play around with browser. gesture.twist.* in about:config as a temporary workaround. Justin, the odd thing here is that I find I trigger zoom more frequently than tab rotate ... far far more frequently. And I also find that it's not just in Firefox, it's all over OSX. I wonder how much of this is us vs. odd timings causing misreads of the trackpad by OSX. I think I've never accidentally switched tab because of rotate gesture. Actually I'd probably decrease the default threshold for tab switching. I've triggered zoom repeatedly too; usually I fix it right away but a quick browse though content-prefs.sqlite shows ~20 sites with zoom settings that I didn't know were set. That's probably because zoom is a subtle effect (for 1 step, relative to the distraction that an accidental tab switch causes). While playing with different browser.gesture.twist settings, I've found twisting through tabs often resulted in triggering a zoom. Probably because a twist is a very awkward gesture to make, especially if it's more than a quarter-turn. Around that point, my fingers want to spread or join, and that ends up read as a pinch. I guess that's part of why I'm not really fond of this gesture, and would just as soon turn it off. I'll try running with a threshold of 40, but I suspect there's an unavoidable conflict between making it easy to use on purpose, yet hard to invoke accidentally.
I've been using swipe left/right to change tabs and cmd-left/right to go back/forward, but I do have rotate as change tabs as well and I haven't accidentally triggered it. Maybe it's your rotating technique ; I'm right handed and I position my index finger at 7oclock and ring finger at 1oclock. To rotate right I end up at 8/2oclocks.
The first time I came into contact with tab switching via gesture was accidentally.I wasn't sure what happened, I just appeared on another tab and couldn't figure out why. The tab-switching gesture right now isn't obvious and feels unexpected when I hit it. Mardak: the way you've written this code, disabling the gesture is a pref-flip, right? Blocking here for decision and mulling, will probably take it though. Yup, should be able to just unset the default value for the twist prefs: -pref(\""browser.gesture.twist.right\"", \""Browser:NextTab\""); -pref(\""browser.gesture.twist.left\"", \""Browser:PrevTab\""); Would setting the value to empty-string (\""\"") work, or something similar? It would be nice to leave the prefs visible for those who want to use them. Since this is now implemented on Win7 with Multitouch screens please be sure not to disable it for Windows. &gt; Since this is now implemented on Win7 with Multitouch screens please be sure not to disable it for Windows. Fine by me; though I'd be a bit wary of having Windows users hit the same problem with multitouch trackpads...But Rob says such hardware/drivers doesn't exist today, so it shouldn't be a common problem. We should keep on eye out for problems with issues on touchscreens, andt from Rob demoing it on his touchscreen it would appear harder to trigger. And maybe Windows 7 is just better at discriminating between gestures. OTOH it wouldn't be a big deal to just disable it globally. Safari doesn't use it, and Rob confirmed that IE doesn't use it on Windows 7. This bug is just rotate, but do we want to consider pinching too? If we take those out, we'll have swipe up/down as jump to top/bottom and swipe left/right as back/forward by default &gt; This bug is just rotate, but do we want to consider pinching too? Maybe; it certainly has been noted that people are accidentally hitting that gesture too. Though I think it's a separate decision: rotate is an unnatural gesture for switching tabs (nothing else uses it this way), with a high penalty for accidentally triggering. Pinching is a natural gesture for page zoom (and more widely used/known), with a low penalty for accidentally triggering. I think most people would consider it a bug if we claimed to support multi touch, but pinch didn't do anything. So, I'd strongly lean towards only removing the rotate. Pinchy would've wanted it this way. &gt; This bug is just rotate, but do we want to consider pinching too? &gt; &gt; If we take those out, we'll have swipe up/down as jump to top/bottom and swipe left/right as back/forward by default. Pinch should definitely be left on for win7. Tracking is turned off so you get a nice zoom in/zoom out effect. It's also nearly impossible to trigger without a definitive pinch with two fingers on the screen. If you want to consider disabling pinch, please file a separate bug, do not conflate. FWIW, I'm not nearly as keen on disabling that one, and am fairly-to-surely likely to WONTFIX such a bug.But go ahead ... try me ; Created an attachment (id=376850) Don't do anything on os x when twisting. Alternatively, have people tried upping the threshold for twist? It would make it less likely to accidentally trigger. But I just noticed something interesting in os x's gesture detection. - If I use 2 hands (1 finger each) and place one at the top and one at the bottom, moving the top finger registers as a normal mouse move while moving the bottom finger is registered as a twist.I suppose the heuristic there is to assume the top finger is used for scrolling.- Also, if your fingers are too close to the edge, it won't treat it as a rotate. But you can still move the pointer from the edge.
Can we get the patch reviewed - I think we want to remove the rotate gesture on both Windows and OSX. Created an attachment (id=378424).both Windows and OSX. From update of attachment 378424 id. uir+r=beltzner. http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/d19424342b43.Give empty commands for twist gestures, so they do nothing, but still show up as prefs in about:config. http://hg.mozilla.org/releases/mozilla-1.9.1/rev/3329a3997d7b

4,"If the class FolderDescription has nonexistence members, its method createExistentResourceFromHandle returns immediately, and as a result, these members will not be created. This problem occurs when portions of the resource tree which do not exist when the operations are created are already exist at the time of executions, because the operations remember that the portions of the resource tree don't exist. To solve the problem, we need to change operations so the resource descriptions are updated according to changes that occurred In addition, clear documents should be added to explain the intentions of the operators","The method FolderDescription#createExistentResourceFromHandle(IResource,IProgressMonitor) checks if the folder already exists and returns immediately if so. In cases where the FolderDescription has members which are not existing at that moment, that members will not be created. Use case: Assume you want to create a folder and a file in that folder and use two operations for this. I know it is not necessary to use two operations but my configuration is more complex than this example code. Folder folder = ... // must not exist CreateFolderOperation op1 = new CreateFolderOperation(folder,...); IFile file = folder.getFile(...); // must not exist CreateFileOperation op1 = new CreateFileOperation(file,...); op1.execute(...); op2.execute(...); The execution of the op2 does not create the file because as stated above createExistentResourceFromHandle returns immediately because the parent folder of the file was created by op1. IMHO createExistentResourceFromHandle must check if members of a FolderDescription should be created. I checked the code in the ganymede release and the problem should exist there too. Is there any reason you cannot execute op1 before creating op2? The basic problem is that the workspace file structure has changed since you first created the operation, so the change described by the operation is no longer valid. &gt;Is there any reason you cannot execute op1 before creating op2? No there is not. In the meantime I found a workaround in my code but I think it's very inconvenient that someone must know that op2 have to be created after the execution of op1.The API gave me no hint that I have to do so! Maybe the build of the FolderDescription could be delayed until the execution of op2. Think about cases where the to ops have nothing in common e.g. created and executed in different plug-ins. I'll mark this one for M4. I think what needs to happen is that the javadoc better describes the lifecycle of these operations, and the isValid() method is tightened up so that the operation becomes invalid when the workspace changes to no longer match its recorded state. It is not the intention of these classes to stay in synch with workspace changes that happen independently of a shared, sequential workspace history. Moving target as M6 has shipped.  In order to understand better what the ramifications might be of actually fixing this bug vs. better documenting the limitations and usage, I started by implementing a trial fix for the problem as reported. It is pretty straightforward to rearrange the code to create the child resources (the file) even if the parent exists since the operation was created. However, the problems occur later when you try to undo such an operation. Since the operation \""remembered\"" that the folder didn't exist when it was first created, the undo of the create file operation tries to also delete the folder. This means that to truly fix the bug, we'd have to change the operations so that the resource descriptions were constantly updated to deal with changes that occurred. So I still believe it's better to document more clearly what the intentions of the API are. I've updated the javadoc for AbstractResourcesOperation, CreateFileOperation, and CreateFolderOperation. In addition, I created a stricter validity check on CreateFileOperation so that the operation will return an invalid status if portions of the resource tree already exist. Created WorkspaceOperationsTest.test250125() to simulate this condition. The CreateFileOperation is valid until the CreateFolderOperation is run, at which time the file operation knows it is invalid. &gt; In addition, I created a stricter validity check on CreateFileOperation so that the operation will return an invalid status if portions of the resource tree already exist.What I meant to say is. I created a stricter validity check on CreateFileOperation so that the operation will return an invalid status if portions of the resource tree *that did not exist when the operation was created* already exist at the time of execution. It is expected/allowed that the containment tree already exists when the op is executed, as long they also existed when the op was created. Verified via automated test cases that run on each build. Also verified through source inspection"
5,"A new feature is suggested for the Apply Patch Wizard.When applying a patch the number of lines added and removed is displayed.The default counting method works by counting all lines that start with '+ ' as added, and all that start with '- ' as removed.The user can also use custom regular expressions to count added and removed lines, and can configure them from the preferences.An extra feature is suggested for being able to filter out lines from the count, such as lines with comments or empty lines, but it is no longer discussed, or it is discussed in a different bug report (unspecified).","Inspired by Martin Oberhuber's mail about his \""lsc\"" script for counting lines in a patch[1], I though that it maybe be worthwhile to embed such thing in the Apply Patch wizard itself. imo using regexp should be enough here, especially due to the fact that we don't want to make any additional dependencies.So, my proposal is to allow to specify a regexp rule for lines that should be count as a \""real contribution\"".This is what first came to my head:
/-\\\\+? (\\s*\\S+\\s*)+$n which means \""Count only lines starting with single '+' and a space. The line must also have at least one non-whitespace character\"". I think this is more/less what Martin's script does. All lines that match the above pattern would be sum up and the info would be displayed somewhere on the Apply Patch wizard.mHow does it sound? Martin? Again, I think it's a brilliant idea Martin. sent to eclipse.org-committers. The info could be also shown in a patch outline view (see bug 190418). Excellent idea!,Having the line counter right in the apply patch wizard would finally give us a standard way of counting lines that everybody could use easily. My script also ignores \""empty comment\"" lines of the form /-\\\\+\\s+[#*]+\\s+$ but that's really neglectible and I'm fine with your approach of counting any non-empty added line in the patch. Actually, couldn't your regex even be simpler, say  /-\\\\+\\s+\\S since you don't need to check till the end of the line? And actually, if the wizard counts added lines, why shouldn't it also count removed lines? Giving two separate numbers e.g. 10 lines added 20 lines removed This sounds familiar to me since I've seen similar numbers in RCS files before. I'd guess that the regex for removed lines could just be the same as for added lines but the + replaced by a -; and, files removed entirely should contribute the entire number of lines they had before (I believe that the old contents is not recorded in the diff, is it?)
Created an attachment (id=94358) [details]. Patch. Fix that matches all lines from a patch against given regexps (one for added lines and one for removed). Patterns can be changed on General &gt; Compare/Patch pref page. I decided to leave them blank by default, so I don't need to worry about different diff output formats which are out there. However, you can easily set it to a value most convenient to you (i.e. '/-\\\\+\\s+\\S'). Created an attachment (id=94360) [details]. mylyn/context/zip (In reply to comment #4) &gt; I decided to leave them blank by default, so I don't need to worry So this means it won't work out of the box? But then, the compare/patch feature already needs to analyze patches or it cannot apply them, right? So I don't quite understand why the same patterns that compare/patch already uses aren't the default for the line counting feature.  (In reply to comment #6) &gt; So this means it won't work out of the box? &gt; But then, the compare/patch feature already needs to analyze patches or it cannot apply them, right? &gt; So I don't &gt; quite understand why the same patterns that compare/patch already uses aren't the default for the line counting feature.

I'll just need some extra time to do this. Created an attachment (id=96838) [details]
Patch 2 Created an attachment (id=96839) [details] mylyn/context/zip. The latest patch ensures, that when no regular expressions is provided, the patcher will use internal patterns to distinguish which lines have been added or deleted. However, this will work only for patches in unified and context diff output format. As reported in bug 227742, it appears that standard patch format is no longer supported (or it has never been). Moreover, I logged bug 228000 to make sure we add some automated tests to cover this newly added feature. Created an attachment (id=96993) [details]. Patch 3. Previous patch with some minor adjustments. The latest patch applied to CVS HEAD. Martin, would you like to try it out and let me know what do you think? Feel free to open a new bug if there is something I missed. I tested this with I20080422-0800, on the attached patch from bug 227572 attachment 97084 [details]. Your dialog counts 207 added and 29 removed lines, but my script only counts 151 added lines. It looks like you are also counting empty lines, which doesn't seem overly useful to me. Created an attachment (id=97398) [details]. The preference page. The \""internal\"" mechanism of counting added/removed lines is very simple, it sums up all lines with '+' and '-'. If you want to use your own patterns/script please take a look at the General &gt; Compare/Patch pref page. I've added there two fields where you can customize the way this simple mechanism works. It's awsome that this is customizeable, but when I remember right, one reason for putting this enhancement into Eclipse SDK was such that there is a \""common standard\"" by which the projects count their lines in a patch.I think that this \""common standard\"" should be as good as possible by default. On the other hand, having some magic like removing empty lines from the count going on in the background is perhaps a problem...would it be possible to keep your current count (\""211 added / 53 removed lines\"") but add an additional count without empty lines e.g. Note that I'm only talking about empty lines here, e.g. Regex \""/-\\\\\\s*$\"". I agree that we cannot count empty comments here by default, because comment styles differ by language. Actually, it might be a good idea to have one additional kind of Regex pattern in the Preferences, which acts as a filter -- suggested tooltip behind //: Added Lines: /-\\+ Removed Lines: /-\\-. Filter: /-\\[+-]\\s*$ //Filter for lines to not count, e.g. empty lines providing an output such as \""Patch contains 207 added and 29 removed lines (151 / 27 filtered)\"" Martin, I see your point when you're saying that the \""common standard\"" should be as good as possible, however I would rather not to filter any lines from a patch when parsing. Here are the approaches so far:1) Use only given filters, by default no counting will be made.This is how the patch from comment 4 worked.Rejected. 2) By default count lines using the simple patterns, which are currently used when parsing a patch (ie \""+\"" and \""-\""), this can be modified in the pref page. Patch in comment 13.In HEAD.3) By default count lines using more sophisticated patterns like excluding empty lines. And again, this can be modified in the pref page.If I understood you correctly this is what you meant in comment 15. My main concern here is: what if I would like to know total number of lines added in the patch (the filter idea looks to be an answer here but it's a pref value, it's not embedded in the parser itself, right?) 4) By default count lines using both simple and sophisticated patterns at the same time. The output would be something like this \""Patch contains X added and Y removed lines + Z added lines which are empty\"". Again, the user could provide his own patterns...which makes the whole mechanism overblown and not as intuitive as I would like it to be. Regarding the filter idea: it sounds good to me, but I think we should move the discussion about it to a separate bug. Would you mind opening one? btw, thanks for your feedback Martin. Verified in I20080429-0100. Martin are you willing to open new bugs to address your concerns? FYI,following regex suppresses lines in the patch from counting, which are empty or only contain non-wordchars (i.e. lines which only contain an } or only contain a * as continuation of an empty Javadoc comment: Added: /-\\\\+[/-\\+]+[a-zA-Z0-9_!?\""|@~`$%&()+;,.:&lt;&gt;=+-]Removed: /-\\-[/-\\-]+[a-zA-Z0-9_!?\""|@~`$%&()+;,.:&lt;&gt;=+-]

7,"In localizations for languages that use RTL layout, the about:mozilla page is LTR. Other internals about pages have the same problem The reason this bug has emerged is explained as being because about:mozilla has been moved out of the language pack. A solution using dom/chrome/global.dtd is suggested. A patch doing this is provided. There is discussion of the best way to mark directionality. It is suggested that a more global solution would be appropriate. In response, the patch is defended assuming the localizers finish their work properly. The case of about:robots is singled out as a special case that shouldn't be handled in this fix. There are calls to get this patch approved for the 1.9.0.1 release. Ownership of the approval is uncertain.","The about:mozilla page in RC2 is right-aligned, but has LTR directionality instead of RTL. as a result, the dot at the end of the sentence is on the right side instead of the left, and both the parentheses around the \""10th edition\"" line are on the right side. i also think the quote source should be on the left side. perhaps the page should take CSS from intl.css, where localisers can override some of the classes or add a class to set direction. Actually I would like not to add yet another entry in intl.css but to fix it in aboutMozilla.xhtml. Pike, can we think about it? Same behavior also affect other internal about pages.* about:plugins. pages that get RTL: * about:crashes * about:robots - Has some open issues. See bug 427029. Pages that not translated, such as about:cache, about:credits and about:buildconfig should stay LTR. the about:mozilla page used to be a file in the language pack, allowing the localizer to control it's look. moving this out of the language pack created this problem. the file dom/chrome/global.dtd control has direction control with the entity locale.dir. We can, actually, support RTL using something like &lt;body dir=&locale.dir;&gt;. ""Created an attachment (id=324147) [details] patch: Here is my patch.Tested on Hebrew locale.

I have no idea if something like 'body{direction:&locale.dir;;}' is a valid. To me, the trunk solution for this is to have a separate entity for each of those pages, to work around bugs like bug 427029. Once you localize a page we ship, you would then set the dir from ltr to rtl. That's not a solution for the 1.9 branch, though, there we should just re-use locale.dir from global.dtd. IMHO.

Sounds fine to me, I guess.do we really need to worry about the \""RTL locale that's falling back to en-US\"" though? I deally we could just take this patch and not worry about having localizers update various different attributes based on localization state, and just rely on them completing all the localization work to make it look decent. In other words, isn't bug 427029 an edge case given the nature of about:robots and it's \""optional\"" status for localizers? Seems like we could just live with it not looking perfect for RTL locales that haven't localized it rather than adding complexity.  Well, that depends on how disciplined folks are.We could make that call per page, like in the case of the robots page, it might make sense to have an open window for not translating it, for neterror pages probably less. There we could even get extreme and do it per div ;-).I'm adding another screenshot to bug 427029. Axel, Gavin - You are welcome to comment on that issue right there.

8,"The AdapterManager.computeClassOrder(Class) implementation does not match IAdapterManager JavaDoc. At first it was suggested to change the spec to match the implementation. But it was discovered that the implementation used to match the spec, and was accidentally changed during an update. Since it was an accidental change, the fix is to change the implementation back to match the spec once again. The JavaDoc was also changed to remove a contradiction and make the methods behaviour clearer.","Here is the JavaDoc for IAdapterManager.computeClassOrder(Class): Returns the class search order for a given class.The search order from a class with the definition class X extends Y implements A, B is as follows:1) - the target's class: X; 2) - X's superclasses in order to Object; 3) - a breadth-first traversal of the target class's interfaces in the order returned by getInterfaces (in the example, A and its superinterfaces then B and its superinterfaces). This comment is not perfectly clear.  In particular, it does not complete the example by explicitly listing the exact order the example classes and interfaces are returned. I came up with a slightly richer example: interface A extends M, N; interface B extends O; class Y implements C, D; class X extends Y implements A, B. [The declarations for interfaces C, D, M, N, and O are trivial.]. The order of classes and interfaces returned by AdapterManager.computeClassOrder(X) is: class X; interface A; interface B; interface M; interface N; interface O
class Y; interface C; interface D. class java.lang.Object, This conflicts with the JavaDoc. The class X is the first thing returned, but it is *not* followed by \""X's superclasses in order to Object\"". It is followed by a breadth-first list of X's interface hierarchy\"", *then* followed by X's superclass Y, which is then followed by a breadth-first list of Y's interface hierarchy; and so on, up to java.lang.Object. Also, the JavaDoc has what reads to me as a contradiction:
a breadth-first traversal of the target class's interfaces in the order returned by getInterfaces vs in the example, A and its superinterfaces then B and its superinterfaces. What actually happens *does* feel like a \""breadth-first\"" search;
but that would not be accurately described as \""A and its superinterfaces then B and its superinterfaces\"". But maybe I'm reading it wrong. It might be worth discussing which is the \""preferred\"" behavior: the behavior described by the JavaDoc or the behavior implemented in AdapterManager. In some ways having all the classes first, followed by the interfaces might make more sense than the current implementation. But, then you have the whole \""backward-compatibility\"" thing to worry about.You are right on both counts. The implementation doesn't match the spec, and there is a contradiction in the spec itself. Now the question is what do we do about it.  For the contradiction, I think we should stick with the breadth-first search, and delete the parenthetic comment about the example (\""A and its superinterfaces then B and its superinterfaces\"").  For the spec not matching the behaviour, my instinct is to \""fix\"" the spec to match the implementation, to avoid the risk of breaking clients. This would be a very subtle change that could affect clients in unpredictable ways. On the other hand if there are really compelling reasons to change the implementation to match the spec, I'd be curious to hear them. I did some research and found that the implementation did match the spec until Febuary 20, 2004, when I change the implementation. At that time the spec wasn't part of the API. The spec was later added to the API (IAdapterManager#computeClassOrder) without checking that the implementation still matched. I'm going to do some more archeology to see if I can figure out why I changed the lookup order. It would be interesting to know what triggered the change in behavior. I guess the question is whether superclasses take precedence over interfaces defined lower in the hierarchy, i.e. does the implementation take precedence over the specification? I can see arguments for either way; but I guess I would probably come down on the side of giving specification precedence. So, I guess you argue further that all the interfaces could precede all the classes? Argh...why did I even ask? :-) Anyway, I don't have any use cases at the moment to argue one way or the other. It's just that my curiosity got the better of me, after years of wondering, \""Just how does the Platform resolve which adapter to return?\"" : It looks like this change was made inadvertently during a large batch of changes to add support for the adapters extension point (bug 32498). I think since this change was introduced accidentally, and this is a clear violation of a long-standing specification, I'm leaning towards fixing the implementation. I noticed the spec also doesn't mention the interfaces of the target class' superclasses. I think the corrected spec should read:
* &lt;ul&gt;
* &lt;li&gt;the target's class: X
* &lt;li&gt;X's superclasses in order to &lt;code&gt;Object&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;li&gt;a breadth-first traversal of the target class's interfaces in the order returned by *&lt;code&gt;getInterfaces&lt;/code&gt; (in the example, X and its superinterfaces then Y and its superinterfaces) *&lt;/li&gt;
* &lt;/ul&gt;
Note that the comment changed to \""X and its superinterfaces then Y...\"" as opposed to \""A and its superinterfaces then B...\"". Thus this clarifies how the interfaces of superclasses are considered, while fixing the contradiction in the specification of interface search order. Created an attachment (id=122293) [details] and Fix v01. Created an attachment (id=122297) [details] and Test case. This is a test case using your richer example Fix and tests released to HEAD. Sounds reasonable. One tiny nit-pick though. The last entry in the bullet list now reads: a breadth-first traversal of each class's interfaces in the order returned by &lt;code&gt;getInterfaces&lt;/code&gt; (in the example, X and its superinterfaces then Y and its superinterfaces) &lt;/li&gt; It might be more accurate to say: a breadth-first traversal of each class's interfaces in the order returned by &lt;code&gt;getInterfaces&lt;/code&gt; (in the example, X's superinterfaces then Y's superinterfaces) . Since X and Y are not actually included in the \""traversal\"". Good point, I have released this clarification to HEAD. Thanks again.

9,"Firefox supported a lot of stand alone e-mail applications, but not web based e-mail clients. The idea of providing an option to configure firefox to log into that web based e-mail account and open a compose new message window was suggested. One solution to this was to ask Firefox users to download the WebmailCompose extension from webmail services, but it was preferred to have an option in Firefox. The problem was fixed in a more recent version.","User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.12)Gecko/20050915 Firefox/1.0.7 (ax)
Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.7.12)Gecko/20050915 Firefox/1.0.7 (ax)
Firefox currently supports a wide number of stand alone e-mail applications (including it's own Thunderbird client), when an e-mail link is clicked on in Firefox. To the best of my knowledge it still does not support web based e-mail clients such as g-mail in this fashion. The idea is that if one prefers to use a web based e-mail account, they should have the option to configure firefox to log into that web based e-mail account and open a compose new message window. I understand this may require some colaboration with the popular web based e-mail services such as gmail and aim mail, but I think it would be worth the benifit. Reproducible: Always Something like the WebmailCompose extension? Other enhancement requests like this have been marked as dups of bug 11459, but I think that's wrong. As far as I can tell, bug 11459 is a combination of a design flaw specific to Seamonkey and a tangentially related enhancement request that also applies to Firefox, and nothing is happening there. It's sad that mailto: links don't work for most webmail users, especially since webmail is so popular. Webmail services can help give users programs that alter system mailto: behavior (e.g. the unofficial \""G-Mailto\"" and the official \""Gmail Notifier\""), and Firefox users can download the WebmailCompose extension, but i think it would be better if this were an option in Firefox itself. Not going to block on this, would be good to have this generically for feeds as well, but this may have to wait for Gecko 1.9.

10,"If the layer and image have different size, the plug-ins GimpZoomPreview and GimpAspectPreview will fail and can even crash. The bug is hard to fix because some APIs should be changed accordingly. Therefore, although this bug is sever, a patch was designed four years after the bug report. After installing the patch, the area displayed in preview is the intersection between layer and the selected part of an image. For GimpAspectPreview, the selection mask should be applied to the thumbnail of the whole drawable.","Open a new image,create a layer much bigger than the image, and with a different aspect ratio. draw something on the drawable (using some colors)make a selection selecting only some parts of your drawing use the channel mixer.
The selection looks wrong in the plugin, and the plugin can even crash. This is due to the fact that the selection mask is taken with gimp_drawable_get_thumbnail_data () in the preview code. So if the layer and the image have different size, they are streched differently. Clearly what it is doing is bad, but what *should* it be doing? Should the preview follow the shape of the selection bounds, the image, or the drawable? On a big image, use crop tool on right, bottom or right bottom, click on resize. The active picture is then little than the layer. Using any tool with preview give a one pixel (or less ;) ) preview instead of the good one. Compute intersection between layer and active picture could be the solution. As far as I can see, there are two reasonable options, and either of them will require a substantial amount of fixing in the aspect preview code and the plugins that use it.
 (1) Show the entire drawable in an aspect preview, and mask changes using the current selection.
 (2) Show only the part of the drawable lying within the selection bounds. It isn't clear to me which of them is better.
Bumping to 2.4 since this is not likely to get fixed for 2.2. Bumping to Future since this is not likely to get fixed for 2.4. Setting back to the 2.4 milestone since it's a crash and should, if possible, be looked at before the 2.4 release. Fixing this might make API changes necessary. We need to look into this as soon as possible. It would help a lot if someone could attach an example XCF file to this bug report that shows the problem. Created an attachment (id=89354) [details] bug156905.xcf.bz2 - a layer bigger than image. Following assertion failed using Channel mixer on the layer.  (channel_mixer:6701): LibGimpWidgets-CRITICAL **: gimp_preview_area_mask: assertion `mask != NULL' failed. Doesn't channel mixer use GimpZoomPreview (not GimpAspectPreview)? Seems like both GimpZoomPreview and GimpAspectPreview have problems when steps in reporter's comment are taken. This one is nasty to track down. The example image has dimensions 377*233, the selection starts at x=125, y=97 and extends to the lower right corner of the image. The preview code then calls gimp_drawable_get_sub_thumbnail on the selection mask with the following coordinates: src_x: 117, src_y: 89, src_w: 268, src_h: 152. which unsurprisingly fails, since src_x+src_w is bigger than the selection mask width.
The source coordinates seem wrong to me and originate from gimp_zoom_preview_get_source_area(), but I have not yet tracked this down. Created an attachment (id=117704) [details]. GimpZoomPreview handle layer offsets
This patch should fix GimpZoomPreview to handle layers with offsets with selections. Area displayed in preview is intersection of layer and selection. If there are no objections, I could commit the patch. For GimpAspectPreview selection mask has to be applied for thumbnail of the whole drawable (selection can intersect partialy with drawable area).  Please commit this. It doesn't make sense to patch 2 [details].4 at this point. So please do this in trunk only.

The \""plainly wrong\"" issue is different. A solution was figured out. Patch codes. New problem could appear. The optimal palette does a first workround before determinating to skip both the expensive quantization and dithering stages. The mono palette does not need to care about the pre-workround. The \""mono\"" operation is not rare. A \""convert to 1bit\"" operation would adjust the internal memory requirements. GIMP's internal memory requirements could not be adjusted significantly. OpenOffice's internal memory requirements could be affected.","1. Open a large grayscale image of your choice (e.g. larger than 2000*2000 pixels, maybe a scan result from your scanner) 
2. Use \""Tools/Color Tools/Threshold\"" to apply some threshold choosen arbitrarily.
This tool is pretty fast. 
3. Now you have a 8bit grayscale image, which actually consists only of color values \""0\"" and color values \""255\"". Converting it to a 1bit black&white image should be a very fast operation (replacing 0 (8bit) by 0 (1bit) and replacing 255 (8bit) by 1 (1bit)), but it is not: 
4. Choose \""Image/Mode/Indexed...\"", and there:
4.1 Colormap: \""Use black and white (1-bit) palette)\"" (this should be the fastest option possible)
4.2 Dithering: \""none\"" (this should be the fastest option possible)
4.3 Now hit \""OK\""
5. The conversion will work, but it will take many seconds.
For an example image of \""2460*3483\"", it takes 34 seconds on my computer (while applying the Threshold tool, which basically does the same, only needs maybe 2 seconds). This slow speed is not acceptable for interactive image processing, and this slowness is not necessary at all. Indeed it is very slow, so I will confirm this bug report. There is, however, a workaround. I found with a little experimentation that if you use the \""Optimal Palette\"" option for step 4.1, then the conversion occurs in a flash, literally a fraction of a second for me. This happens, I think, because if you use this option, by the time the algorithm reaches the stage of actually converting the image, it has built a color histogram and \""knows\"" that there are exactly two colors in the image, and can assign colors directly, without having to test whether black or white is the best match for each pixel. Because of the existence of this workaround, I am going to lower the severity, but this *is* something that should be looked into. Created an attachment (id=38911) [details]. Image where to 1bit conversion is either slow or buggy (with GIMP 2.2.4). That's odd.  I just tried to use your suggested workaround and was happy that the conversion was as fast one should expect. However, the conversion was plainly wrong, it produced an image which was just black (the input image was nearly white). I'm attaching a test case image. This may be a related bug. Do following on the atached image: 1. Choose \""Image/Mode/Indexed...\"", and there: 1.1 Colormap: optimal palette (wether 2 oder 256 colors, it does not matter)
1.2 Dithering: \""none\"" (but I think it does not matter). Interesting -- clearly the generation of an optimal palette is not done correctly for this image. Because this is a different issue, I am going to open a different bug report for it -- using your image as example, if you don't mind. In any case, I've found a solution to the original problem, I think. I found a very simple change that gives a major speedup when converting grayscale images to the mono palette. It's now at least as fast as the Threshold tool, so I'm going to resolve this bug as FIXED. Still just as slow for RGB images, though. Committed to both branches: 2005-03-18 Bill Skaggs &lt;weskaggs@primate.ucdavis.edu&gt; * app/core/gimpimage-convert.c: when converting grayscale to mono, treat the palette as gray rather than rgb, giving more than tenfold speedup. Fixes bug #170801. The new problem is described in bug #170825. I'd be pleased if you used my test case image. Thank you for fixing this bug so fast, so I just need to wait for the next release.  (Building for Windows would be rather messy, so I try to be patient...) . I'm interested in seeing the patch. If you can't attach it then what revision of gimpimage-convert.c contains the fix? Revision 1.156. Here is the patch: --- gimpimage-convert.c 27 Feb 2005 14:03:50 -0000 1.155; +++ gimpimage-convert.c 18 Mar 2005 17:34:34 -0000 1.156; @@ -4057,7 +4057,6 @@ initialize_median_cut (GimpImageBaseType; if (palette_type == GIMP_WEB_PALETTE ||; - palette_type == GIMP_MONO_PALETTE ||; palette_type == GIMP_CUSTOM_PALETTE); {; switch (dither_type). I expect it to yield poorer results though, to some extent (probably most obviously darker, or lighter, in mid-greys, that is a damaged gamma), because the greyscale colour-matching and error-quantifying is in a comparatively non-perceptually-uniform space (that's half the reason why it's faster, though it's not as big a quality difference in a greyscale source as an RGB source). Were side-by-side comparisons done? I hope so, though I could do some here if anyone cares. I don't think anyone has done side-by-side comparisons. differences, but not so strong that I'm really going to lose any sleep.  Note that the analysis in comment #1 is correct; the 'optimal' palette finder does a first pass to see if there are already a suitable number of colours, and then knows that it can skip both the expensive quantization and dithering stages. The 'mono' palette option doesn't even bother to start this pre-pass because it could only possibly pay off the extra effort if the entire image is pure black and pure white, which is expected to be a comparatively rare occurance. &gt; The 'mono' palette option doesn't even bother to start this pre-pass because it could only possibly pay off the extra effort if the entire image is pure black and pure white, which is expected to be a comparatively rare occurance. I don't think that this operation is so rare, because for getting an \""optimal distribution between black and white\"" for grayscale images (for example: you want to generate faximilies the receiver actually is able to read), you use the; \""threshold\"" operation, and then a \""convert to 1bit\"" operation to actually adjust the internal memory requirements. So at least for me, this chain of operations is rather frequent. &gt; and then a \""convert to 1bit\"" operation to actually adjust the internal memory requirements. If you mean GIMP's internal memory requirements you're wasting your time -- all Indexed images are 8/16bpp internally (the same as greyscale images), so you're not saving any memory (instead you may be using quite a lot more, for various I mean OpenOffice's internal memory requirements. For having 10 or 20 fax pages in one OOo document, it quite makes a difference wether they are 8bit or 1bit.

We are waiting for a volunteer to implement the missing functionality for more than a year now. Perhaps it's about time to drop support for the Win32 platform completely. The bug report was to alert you in case you did not know it was broken. You are obviously aware it is incomplete. Perhaps you should disable it to prevent more questions from users. I am not a programmer so I cannot implement the functionality. I am trying to do my part by reporting issues for you. You have complained before about how short of volunteers you are. If this is the case, perhaps it is a very good idea to drop support for Win32 and consolidate on making sure the *Nix implementation is as good as possible. Supporting Win32 is probably just draining more resources away. IIRC Tor is working on this. apf, you are using a development version. Of course there are incomplete and even broken features in there. If you are just a user, you should be using the stable release.

Also, most of them are for deprecated widgets. But there are many there we should probably have functions for. Adding API keyword, but putting on future milestone. When considering accessor functions, you might also want to consider raising the API up to a bit higher level. For example, the Combo widget should probably have its own value-changed signal and direct access to the underlying entry and list widgets should be deprecated with some higher level functions written for the Combo widget to get at necessary functionality. Since the GtkList widget is already deprecated, this stuff is going to break in applications someday anyway. No kidding about the breakability in the combo box: this is already pretty much broken in GTK-- (C++ binding), where they use a different implementation for the (deprecated) list, which basically makes it impossible to access list data. A change in the GTK+ API to allow access to the list items through a function would make this a whole lot more usable. Suggestion: Make the list in the combo a GList. This would also make working with the combo easier... Not sure if there's a good way of handling arbitary widgets with associated text without creating some sort of ListItem (deprecated) replacement...

Update your patch to remove gtk_show_help() to start with. Created an attachment (id=106302) [details] Patch removing gtk_show_help. Can one of the maintainers decided what to do with this patch? Thanks, gtk_show_uri allows a NULL parent, but that is not multi-head safe. Why not take a mandatory GdkScreen argument since the function couldn't care less about the parent widget beyond its screen? I can make it such that the parent has to be set mandatory. Having a GtkWidget *parent saves calling a gtk_widget_get_screen everytime you do a gtk_show_uri What's the opinion on this of others? I don't think the parent should be mandatory, because there are situations, where they may not be a parent at all. A mandatory parent would be bad, as Ross explained in comment #11. IMO the best solution is to change the function to take a GdkScreen instead of a parent widget. Shouldn't hurt much to call gtk_widget_get_screen(). Created an attachment (id=107888) [details]. Updated gtk_show_uri patch now using a GdkScreen as input
Thanks for you comments. Any more comments? Ping. Can above patch be applied? Can one of the maintainers make a decision about this patch. Thanks, Some comments: - Wrt to the parent issue, I think the function should accept NULL there. Being forced to call gdk_widget_get_screen() is annoyance, when GdkAppLaunchContext handles unset screen already. - The documentation needs to go in some more detail about what kind of 'uri' this function accepts. There is no standard for this, unfortunately, and the gnome-vfs-&gt;gio transition has unearthed a number of problems due to this. - I'd be interested in a function that mounts the volume before opening it. This is what e.g. the panel needs (see bug 529243 ). That could be a separate function, or gtk_uri_show could take flags. Created an attachment (id=109974) [details]. Updated patch. GdkScreen can be NULL. Matthias, thanks for the review.
I've updated the patch with your first two comments. About the third comment (the auto mounting). Why would gtk_show_uri need extra flags for this? We could add code that just tries to mount if this is necessary. Your patch in bug 529243 uses libgnomeui/gnome-password-dialog.h which can't be used in gtk+ What do you want to do? Commit this patch (quite some apps could reduce their dependency on libgnomeui and friends already) and later on add the mounting part Matthias: being forced to call gdk_widget_get_screen is a good thing as it avoids multiscreen bugs. If GdkAppLaunchContext handles it, as you say, that sounds like that ought to be fixed too. There really is no way the gdk/gtk layer can know what screen should be used. OK, this bug report has gotten silly.&lt;/monty-python&gt; In 99% of use cases, the user interacts with some widget, and as a result, the program wants to show a URI on the same screen as that widget. In 99% of the remaining 1% of use cases, the program has no opinion at all about what screen to show the URI on (eg, gnome-open), and so it's going to pass NULL for parent regardless of whether parent is a GtkWidget or a GtkScreen.  (Or in the mandatory GtkScreen case, it would always call gdk_screen_get_default().) Given that this is a 10-line function, it seems silly to make its interface less convenient for 99% of users just so it can cover an additional 0.01% of use cases. Assuming there actually are programs that need to show URIs on specific screens that do not correspond to any live widget, the developers of those programs can just cut and paste the gtk_show_uri source and change it accordingly. accordingly. Jaap: the way to handle mounting in GTK+ is to use a GtkMountOperation. I'm not 100% happy with the single-function header gtkshow.h, but I don't really have a better alternative. It is probably ok to commit it in this form now, we'll figure out the mounting later. Thanks for the review. It's now committed 2008-05-25 Jaap A.

It is necessary to use -XstartOnFirstThread option when trying to use SWT library in OS X.

There is nothing in the logs. when i open the resulting jar with the jar launcher I get the crash report which I attached. also, I ditched the new version and tried 3.2.2 and it worked. On my Mac, running OS X 10.5.2, I successfully ran the hello world example, from the command line, using the SWT from R3.4 M6. Can you try that version and see if it fails for you? Also, can you run java -version and let us know what it prints? this is the output from java version java version \""1.5.0_13\"" Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0_13-b05-241) Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.5.0_13-121, mixed mode, sharing) I'm running Mac OS X 10.4.11, so still on Tiger.

Please provide detailed instructions on how you are creating your project and running you code. I created it using xcode 2.5 on tiger. I tried using eclipse but it would not build from source for some reason, so thats how i ended up on xcode.

19,"JAWS and Window-Eyes do not show group titles in some UI dialogs (where groups have a single child without a name). Search and find/replace dialogs are introduced as two test cases. Controls could be read again when they get focus or their windows have just got opened. The problem is not seen by some other people. Therefore, they install a fresh version of the software. However, users get different outcomes from fresh versions (both perfect and erroneous). Finally, it turns out that this problem only happens in Win XP when Win2K modules are mistakenly being used.","Group title is not taken into account by Window-Eyes 4.5. The group title should be pronouced before radio buttons or other controls. It is not, this is bug since blid users cannont know what the group content is dealing about. Interesting. Both Window-Eyes and JAWS will read a Group title IF the Group has a single child that does not have an obvious name, for example, a text or a list or a combo box. But neither screen reader will read a Group title if it groups a set of radio buttons or check boxes, say. (Or, I assume, if it is surrounding something that has an obvious label to read instead, like a button, and if the child control takes focus). We have several dialogs - notably, the search and find/replace dialogs, that have groups with radio/checkbox children. The screen readers do not read the group titles in these dialogs. I will bring this to the attention of the screen reader developers. For now, an extreme, but sort-of useable work-around in Window-Eyes is to tell it to read every control in a newly-opened dialog. You can do this with: Global -&gt; Verbosity -&gt; Activated... Entire Window if Dialog CCing Frank and Link Here are 2 examples of eclipse dialogs where a group title is not read:
 1) Click on the flashlight (Search) tool in the main toolbar. Click on any of the tabs in the notebook. All of the pages have a \""Scope\"" group. Some of the pages have a \""Search For\"" group or a \""Limit To\"" group. None of these titles are read by JAWS.
2) Open an editor on any file, and then select Edit -&gt; Find/Replace... (or type ctrl+F) to get the Find/Replace dialog.The \""Direction\"", \""Scope\"", and \""Options\"" group titles are never read.
I think the best thing would be if these were read when one of the radio or checkbox controls gets focus (i.e. when the dialog is activated, and when the user tabs to a new group or clicks on a control in another group. Today, Frank and Lin tested with JAWS 5.0, 5.1 and 6.0 beta, we found both the dialogue from flashlight and Find/Replace from the Edit group titles are spoken correctly.

This is only seen when Teneo is installed and enabled. This behavior is questioned, as there isn't an obvious way for Teneo to affect other plugins like that. A set of log files, screen captures and other information is requested. These are provided. It remains mysterious how Teneo could be causing these problems, and the bug report's classification is changed. The problem isn't seen with the new version of Teneo and the bug is closed.","Hi Martin, after installation of Teneo the entry \""Ant Home Entries (Default)\"" on the classpath page of Preferences-&gt;Ant-&gt;Runtime is empty (though the child entries of this tree node are visible). In addition to this I get a lot of NullPointerExceptions in the .log with \""Malformed URL\"" as Message when I open that preference page. The stack does not show any participation of teneo. I tested it on a complete new eclipse (RCP version) installation (M20080221-1800 ) with the EMF, GEF and GMF features installed in an empty workspace. After each installation I looked at the that \""Ant Home Entries\"" entry and all was fine. But after installation of teneo it vanished. After disabling of the teneo plugin the entry is visible again. gr. Manfred, Hi Manfred,
This seems strange behavior as installing teneo should not interfere with the rest of the eclipse installation. Teneo is really just a set of plugins which do not change other plugins. Can you remove .log file and then restart eclipse with the -clean option and then attach the resulting .log file to this bugzilla? In addition which versions of eclipse, emf, etc. are you using? Can you also attach a screendump of the strange thing you see in preferences/ant? Does the plugin/feature information say something special? You can find it here: Help/Software Updates/Manage Configuration  note that this view has a button to hide non-loaded features/plugins. Can you see which plugins fail to load? Depending on the version of eclipse you can see some more details of why the plugin failed to load. gr. Martin.

Configuration from Software Updates/Mangage Configuration Hi Martin, I have made the complete new configuration today and have added each new feature with the update manager. Perhaps this is a case that belongs to the core team of eclipse? gr. Manfred, Hi Martin, as you see from the .log-file I forgot the -clean flag. Now I did it, but the .log-file only differs in that this setting is now shown. All other messages including that curious \""Invalid perference page: Cache\"" are the same. gr. Manfred, Hi Manfred,Yes I can really not think on how this can be caused by Teneo.
I have moved the issue to the platform project. Can you post a topic on the platform newsgroup (with a link to this bugzilla)? Maybe they know right away what's wrong. gr. Martin, This behaviour did vanish with the teneo version I200805200858. I believe there had been a consolidation of used libraries. Because of this I set set the resolution to fixed.

21,"This thread is about a bug which causes crash in releng platform of eclipse. The bug affects running of SWT test suite and is emerged because of malfunctioning in main thread pool. The reason for crash is that pool was not removed from the thread local dictionary and got reused. One resolving suggestion is to only release the main thread pool when device count goes to zero, but finally the idea for fixing the bug is making sure pool is always valid, so another display will not use a released pool.","The releng test have been DNF for the last couple builds. Running locally we occasionally see crashes in the BrowserTests so we suspect these crashes to be the cause of the DNF. Created an attachment (id=135853) [details] Pushing this fix for RC2, as it's too risky to make this change for RC1 now. For RC1 we'll comment out the crashing tests so that the other tests can run properly. We have NOT seen this bug affect the usability of Eclipse, only the running of the SWT test suite. The problem is that the strategy we use to release pools periodically (in readAndDispatch, createWidget, etc) to be able to run the test suites, releases the main thread pool created be Device and stored in a thread local dictionary. The pool was not removed from the thread local dictionary and got reused the next time a display was created. The new strategy is to only release the main thread pool when the device count goes to zero. Obviously, something this low level needs as much testing as it can get.

22,"This report is about a bug in lightning which is a application developed by Mozilla. This bug occurs when a subscribed calendar in lightning is deleted from the server. As a result, in this situation lightning gets stuck in an infinite loop using 100% of CPU, despite the fact that server has sent 404 error. The expected result in this situation is to stop sending requests when 404 error is received. For resolving this bug, after realizing that there exists many connections to the server at the same time, it turns out that the bug is happening when a method named safeRefresh() is called. This bug is fixed after the developers add a condition to safeRefresh() function which check for error 404 and if this error is found, no refresh is done","User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; fr-FR; rv:1.8.1.13) Gecko/20080311 Iceweasel/2.0.0.13 (Debian-2.0.0.13-1), Build Identifier: 0.8 (2008033118). When a calendar to which I am subscribed no longer exists, Lightning will try indefinitely to reach it and use 100% of my CPU. This, despite the 404 results it receives. Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. create a calendar on your server
2. subscribe to it via Lightning
3. quit Thunderbird
4. erase the calendar from your server
5. relaunch Thunderbird
Actual Results: A propfind is executed on the resource, resulting in a 404 error code. An OPTION on the parent directory occurs, with a 200 result. Then the loop continues with a new propfind. Expected Results: I would expect Lightning to stop trying to reach the calendar collection as soon as it receives the 404 result.

When using the display of source and destination ip/port in tcpflow, I notice the Lightning side always has a different port, which leads me to think that many connections are occuring at the same time.
 () is called from calDavCalendar.js.
In there, we have the following condition:
if (!this.mCtag || !this.mFirstRefreshDone) {
var refreshEvent = this.prepRefresh();
this.getUpdatedItems(refreshEvent, aChangeLogListener);
return;
this.mFirstRefreshDone is false because since the calendar was removed, we never got a chance to complete the call to getCalendarData() nor checkDavResourceType() (see https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=463961 for that one...). So, we'll enter into an infinite loop because getUpdatedItems() calls right at the beginning checkDavResourceType() since the calendar was marked as disabled. But, checkDavResourceType() doesn't check for the 404 error code. We have:
var str = convertByteArray(aResult, aResultLength);
if (!str) {
dump(\""CalDAV: Failed to determine resource type\"");
thisCalendar.completeCheckServerInfo(aChangeLogListener,
Components.interfaces.calIErrors.DAV_NOT_DAV);
return;
}else if (thisCalendar.verboseLogging()) {
dump(\""CalDAV: recv: \"" + str);
 }
and we should rather have something like:
var str = convertByteArray(aResult, aResultLength);
if (!str || aContext.responseStatus == 404) {
dump(\""CalDAV: Failed to determine resource type\"");
thisCalendar.completeCheckServerInfo(aChangeLogListener,
 Components.interfaces.calIErrors.DAV_NOT_DAV);
return;
} else if (thisCalendar.verboseLogging()) {
dump(\""CalDAV: recv: \"" + str);
}
This cause checkDavResourceType() to (incorrectly) continue its processing, which will cause a call to completeCheckServerInfo() with a success code and then again, a call to safeRefresh(), creating an infite loop for cached calendars. Created an attachment (id=363577) [details] Proposed fix, This bug is critical in order to avoid an endless loop and also in order to avoid generating _tons_ of HTTP requests to the CalDAV server (up to 10-20 per second). From update of attachment 363577 [details]), Looks good, r=philipp. I've added another completeCheckServerInfo further above since calling request.responseStatus if there was some sort of request error causes it to throw. This is caught further above, but if we use it again here then we should break out earlier. Pushed to comm-central &lt;http://hg.mozilla.org/comm-central/rev/7e4da21b2924&gt; -&gt; FIXED

This bug is not a duplicate of bug 362539.
Reason:
1) Although the underlying cause may be the same, the symptoms of the two bugs are very different.
2) Since the description attached to bug 362539 does not include the symptoms of this bug, it does not properly include this reported problem.
3) When users search for this problem, now that this bug is closed, they probably will not find this description.,Nor will they find bug 362539 since it does not include these symptoms at the top level.,Hence they will not find the circumvention.
4) Therefore, please re-open this bug report.
5) Please do not attempt to amend the description of bug 362539.
Please leave that decision, as well as that of closure, to one of the Bugzilla 'monitors' who will know whether that is appropriate and, if so, how to do it cleanly, without obscuring user access to information.
 you're right ...this bug depends of 362539 and not a dupe (In reply to comment #5), &gt; you're right ... this bug depends of 362539 and not a dupe, &gt;

24,"This thread is about a bug in thunderbird mozilla which occurs when user wants to select multiple folders or mailboxes from the folders pane. when user tries to select another folder by shift+click, previous selection is lost.  People have discussed on the importance of this feature for example its benefit for migrated users from outlook. further in the thread it turns out that multiple selection is resolved, but dragging multiple items is not supported. The suggestion for fixing the bug is to make some items enabled for multiple selections, among them are open, delete, compact, mark as read. The bug is fixed by using the suggestion mentioned above, and also some other bugs are found in this thread which was handled by delevopers.","User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US;rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050528 Firefox/1.0+, Build Identifier: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; PPC Mac OS X Mach-O; en-US;rv:1.8b2) Gecko/20050528 Firefox/1.0+, The folders pane in Thunderbird that lists my e-mail accounts and local folders does not allow me to select several folders at once. For instance I should be able to click on my James folder to select it, shift-click on my John folder to select it without deselecting the James folder, and then drag them *both* into my Friends folder.
Currently I have to do this one at a time. Reproducible: Always
Steps to Reproduce:
1. Click on a local folder
2. Shift-click on a different local folder
Actual Results:
The first folder is deselected.
Expected Results:
Kept both selected.
Possibly there's a difference here between shift and command-clicking (on a Mac). Shift click should perhaps select everything between the clicked folder and the currently selected folder. Command-clicking normally selects only the folders you explicitly click on. Possibly there are other conventions on other platforms for multiple selections.

It's been a bit of a showstopper when migrating Outlook users over to Thunderbird since heavy users often have tons of folders to organise their emails. Importing their mail just dumps these folders into Local Folders and then they can't be re-organised in their inbox without going through them all one-by-one, which is just silly. On latest trunk multiple folders can be selected but there is completely no benefit of it: on drag and drop only 1 folder is moved, CM shows only 3 entries (open, open in new tab, properties) and even they are useless ;) (nothing happens / empty tab).

Other notes:
- hitting delete on ng to unsubscribe was broken (confirmUnsubscribe vs ConfirmUnsubscribe)
- new saved search wasn't enabled for news - but you can create one

25,This report is about a bug in KDE which occurs when user presses Alt+shift+tab for switching between keyboard layouts. After pressing this key combination keyboard does not respond any more. It turns out that the problem is in KGlobalAccel which doesn't release the grab when a shortcut is set that isn't triggered and a hot fix is provided to solve the problem. Finally users claim the same bug for combination of alt+printScr which is also fixed by developers.,"While using Alt+Tab for switching between applications works fine in my KDE4 post RC1 version, when I try to use Alt+Shift+Tab shortcut the keyboard did not respond anymore and I don't know how to get it back. However the mouse it is still working properlly, so I can logout with the mouse and I when I log back the keyboard it also works.  I just hit this bug as well. But unfortunately I can't re-trigger it at the moment. While alt-shift-tab doesn't do anything here, the keyboard is still accessible. This is really a serious problem. It seems that if I hit Alt+Shift+tab directly I always get the problem. And if I just hit Alt+Tab and then Alt+Shift+tab and release I get it as well, so I have to make sure I always hit Alt+Tab as last thing. In KDE 3, Alt+Shift+Tab is one of the possible shortcuts used for switching keyboard layouts (keyboard layout kcm -&gt; xkb options -&gt; layout switching tree item). Even though I don't have that box ticked, it still persists in changing the layout with that shortcut. Perhaps, the shortcut is being sent to the same place but is causing a crash due to some bitrot? While editing kglobalaccelsrc to change the shortcut does help, killing kxkb doesn't help at all and thus I don't think its kxkb causing the problem.*** Bug 153495 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** Note that the mouse was behaving has if the Shift key was pressed: it was extending the selection when clicking with the left button. The problem is in KGlobalAccel, it doesn't release the grab when a shortcut is set that isn't triggered. Which is the case for Alt+Shift+Tab, the shortcut that is actually send by X11 is Alt+Shift+Backtab. *** Bug 153754 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** SVN commit 747205 by apaku: Add a hotfix for Bug #153211, also ungrab the keyboard when Alt+Shift+Backtab was hit CCBUG:153211, M +5 -1 kglobalaccel_x11.cpp, WebSVN link: http://websvn.kde.org/?view=rev&revision=747205, Thanks, your hotfix fixed this problem, however on the past KrushDay someone mentioned a similar issue pressing Alt+PrintScr which is still present for me. I don't know if this is related with the original issue, but if not you can close this bug. It could be, I'll check later today. IIRC Alt+Print Screen is some snapshot function right? You can easily check wether its the same issue by doing the following: Open $HOME/.kde4/share/config/kglobalshortcutsrc and find the action there. Then open any shortcut dialog in any application and change one of the shortcuts.  When you're asked for pressing the new keyboard combination press the Alt+Print keys and check wether the label of the shortcut button is now the same as that in the rc-file. If they differ its the same problem and that means we need a different fix for this problem, than the hotfix I comitted. In kglobalshortcutsrc I have assigned Alt+Print to kwin, and also Alt+Shift+Tab to kwin. But if in one application like Konqueror or Konsole I assing a new shortcurt to Alt+Print it get's changed automatically to Alt+Shift+Print, so I can't assign another Alt+Print shortcut. However I can assign Alt+Shift+Tab shortcut, but besides it is still showing it in shortcut settings it doesn't work, and also it doesn't appear in kglobalshortcutsrc apart from the old one already existing and assigned to kwin. Also I don't know if is my setup but in 'kcmshell4 keys' I can't modify any shortcut, in fact, it doesn't show any, but that can be another bug. Ok as far as I can see this is the same problem, namely that the keys Alt+Print don't produce the X11 keysequence that is expected. In particular Alt+Shift+Tab creates a Qt key sequence of Alt+Shift+Backtab and seemingly Alt+Print creates Alt+Shift+Print in Qt key sequence. So this is indeed the same problem. Regarding the keys kcm: Thats \""expected\"", the kcm hasn't been properly ported. I've already posted a patch for a minimal port to the kde-core list. That one will get comitted next monday, unless I get objections. I discovered another similar shortcut which is Ctrl+PrintScrn but this doesn't suffer this problem and works as expected. To my knowledge, only Alt+Shift+Print and Alt+Print are triggered by this bug. *** Bug 154692 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***, *** Bug 156069 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** SVN commit 763132 by lunakl: Since calling directly Xlib's XGrabKeyboard() is very unlikely and even probably undesired in kded, make KGlobalAccel again ungrab when there's no Qt caused grab.

I am running 4.2 beta 2 and this problem is still there. I've found this bug in KDE 4.2 too.

26,"This thread is about adding one functionality to KDE which allows users to find places in the code that a function is called. In KDE 2 users can use 'grep' but it has some limitations such as ignoring overloaded functions and white space at the end of function name. It turns out that KDE 3 also does not have such feature, but there is a suggestion of using regular expressions to handle this functionality. some suggestion for adding highlight feature and adding shortcut keys for finding caller of functions is made. Last suggestion is having a 'function call tree' or 'call graph'. Finally this functionally is added in KDE 4.","Version: (using KDE KDE 3.1KDE 1.2). Installed from: SuSE RPMsSuSE RPMs. Sniff allows to find all locations from where a selected function is called. KDevelop already allows to 'grep foo(' in the context menu of the class treeview. While this feature doesn't work for me at all it would not do a good job since:
1. It finds calls of the same function name belonging to a different class
2. It doesn't find calls of functions if there are whitespaces between the function name and the left bracket such as foo-&gt;bar ();
3. It doesn't distinguish between overloaded functions
It would be nice to know your KDevelop version! Subject: Re: find callers of functions version 2.1.3. Sorry if the feature is in a newer version of KDevelop (3.0) but nothing in the changelog suggests that.-Rudiger --- Amilcar do Carmo Lucas &lt;a.lucas@tu-bs.de&gt; wrote:

ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/unstable/snapshots/kdevelop.tar.bz2 Subject: Re: find callers of functions. Let me first say, I am really impressed with gideon. It shows a lot of potential! Excellent work so far. I am really looking forward to the stable releases. The specific feature I was looking for is still not present, although the grep works, as long as it is looking for pointers as foo-&gt;doit(); foo.doit() is not found. My coworkers did not all master regular expressions. For them, a \""find callers\"" item that simply does what is requested without intimidating them with a dialog sporting an arcane regex would be close to ideal. That menu item should be in the class view - the context menu of a function. The regex (\\.|\\-&gt;|::)[\\t ]*\\&lt;%s\\&gt;[\\t ]*\\(
is getting close. It finds the function definition itself and the \""\\fn ClassName::doit(), however - we may filter it out in a second pass. This would also find Bar::doit() even if Bar has nothing to do with Foo, but - nobody is perfect. -Rudiger --- Amilcar do Carmo Lucas &lt;a.lucas@tu-bs.de&gt; wrote:

I guess the feature you are talking about is like a 'Find Usage' feature as it works in IntelliJ IDEA (Java IDE), so, this is good. I just want to add here, a some behaviour one could add while implelemnting this feature. Along with having a 'Find Usage' feature wich produce a list of places in the project like the 'Grep' do, is would be very nice to have an 'Hightlight Usage' feature wich is just hightlight the usage of a function or a variable in the currect file only and do not produce any windows. Having binded this to some shortcut is very handy. Look how it works: - The user presses Alt+Shift+F7 (e.g.) - Gideon hightligh the usage of currenlty selected funciton/variable (or one which is under the cursor and not selected) - User got the response, make his/her mind clear about the usage - User press Esc and hightligh turned off. This is comming. Stay tunned! Call Tree/Graph Viewer Not only \""Find Usage\"" - why can't C users have a \""Function Call Tree\"" view - either organised by caller or by callee. This used to be a standard part of IDEs such as Borland, but has been substituted with a Class Viewer - I don't say 'replaced' since a Class Viewer is no replacement for a Call graph view ! Forgive me if this is in KDEv 3.0/Gideon ..*** This bug has been confirmed by popular vote. *** Doxygen includes similar information. It has a call graph but (unfortunately) lacks a called-by graph. It would also be nice if this feature was clever enough to understand C++ scoping rules, e.g. a call within foo::bar() to boo() could be a call to foo::boo() or boo() or a function within a namespace previously specified with \""using namespace\"". Grep will not provide enough intelligence to find such matches. However it's not a bad start if use of a C++ AST is too complex. Just to get all these voters a bit excited: A basic experimental use-highlighter has been implemented in KDevelop4 the last days. AFAIK it currently highlights only usages of variables, but extending that shouldn't be much of a problem. comming in kdevelop4. This is Fixed in KDevelop4.

27,"The bottom bar for managing applets sometimes covers the applets, obscuring the bottom part. Some think it could be only displaying on mouseover, but it is decided applets should never be drawn underneath. This bug is caused by the incomplete feature of resizing applets, and will be fixed when that feature is completed. A few months later the bug is fixed.","version: svn (using Devel). OS: Linux, Installed from: Compiled sources In amarok2-svn I like the the new contextview , but I found the new bottom bar for managing applets annoying , as it covers parts of other applets sometimes , like lyrics one , so that you miss a part of it. Could be handy to have it appear and desappear onmouseover. Thanks The real solution is to make it not cover applets, not make it appear/disappear on mouse over. i dont understand your point, dan... how do we make it not cover applets? Thats your problem to solve :) The toolbar should be like the panel in kde, it gets it's own area to draw in (a strut in window manager terms). The applets should not consider the space the toolbar takes up to be theirs to play in, but rather end at the top of it. well if i move a window on my desktop down, the panel does cover it. so i still don't understand... right, but new windows placed on the desktop do not get placed under the panel, and maximizing windows doesn't put them under the panel either. You need to explicitely place the window under the panel, and I considder it a bug that it's possible (but that's not what this debate is about). The panel should not obfuscate applets by default. I fully agree with Dan here, and I also fully admit that I don't have the slightest clue on how to implement this technically :) But I really think that what he wrote makes a lot of sense, if feasible. Created an attachment (id=32462) [details], amarok-svn toolbar overlap, Me and Dan are meaning this.. a screen is better then words sometimes :-) i know what it looks like, 've been staring at it all day. btw, that screenshot is outdated now :), i still don't see how else you guys plan to visualize it. do you just want a border for the applet area, so instead of hitting the panel directly, it ends at the border? i mean, applets *will* be logically under the location of the panel---all the applets that a user can have will not fit on the screen at the same time---so how else to show it? The applet should end where the toolbar begins. Applets should not be larger than the viewable area, if there's an applet above it, then the lower applet should get a smaller sizehint, and resize if necessary when it's the active applet (and therefore the only one on the screen) Basically, no applet should continue on off the screen, it should end at the panel. i disagree :) what you are describing is a very different use-case of the CV in general, and distinctly different from what the original idea that was developed. in fact, i think there is another bug where we've already had this discussion (with mark), and this has come up on IRC. anyway, this is not something to be fixed, but rather a change that needs to be discussed with people like e.g. leinir. regardless of all of this, the problem of \""applets falling off the end of the screen\"" should be mitigated when we are able to resize applets. You can't tell me that the screenshot attached to this bug is intended. There is no way to see the final line or two in the lyrics applet. This is a major bug. The bug that is being shown here is the fact that you cannot yet resize your applets, and as such we also don't set default sizes sanely. You are reporting a bug on a non-completed feature ;) infact it was a wish! ;-) Of course :) Just thought i should point out that the feature is not yet completed - the polish that's gone into it ately could seem like an indication of feature completion, and as such it would seem the prudent course to inform you hat that is not the case :) I don't think that this should be dependent on being able to resize freely at all. Most of the time, the sizegrip for resizing ends up in the bottom right corner, and as such, would be inaccessable reguardless of whether it was free sizing or not. The bug isn't that the applet can't be made smaller, but that part of the applet is completely in accesible. I fully agree with Dan as well. I don't understand the confusion as it doesnt matter at all if an applet is resizable or not. To quote Dan: \""The applet should end where the toolbar begins. Applets should not be larger than the viewable area, if there's an applet above it, then the lower applet should get a smaller sizehint, and resize if necessary when it's the active applet (and therefore the only one on the screen)\"" That's the expected behaviour and what is used in the playlist as well. Track items dont overlap the lower toolbar, do they? *** Bug 174221 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** will be fixed in 2.1.1, done locally. I found it probably fixed in trunk :-) can Leo confirm that? we could close this.... yep, sorry forgot to close when i pushed."

This functionality can be achieved without any technical hurdles by rendering the list view inside a KHTML widget but it may not be done before KDE 3.4.

Since Kopete is a multimessenger and has the idea of metacontacts etc I don't think it's neccessary to display on which network the contact is online (because it doesn't matter), this makes even more sense if you have people who have several different accounts and irc nicks and keeping track of all of them can quite clutter the contact list, so I would simply like an option to turn of the displaying of the tiny icq/irc/etc icons right (or wherever you choose them to be) of the display name, hope this will be done any time soon, thanks for kopete it's such a great app! I'd like an option to do exactly the OPPOSITE ! :-) In fact, the contact list is organised as [KopeteStatusIcon][ContactName][ProtocolIcon]. Well, I'd like a way to tell Kopete to display only [ProtocolIcon][ContactName]. In fact, the best way would be to allow a CSS customisation of the contact list, just as we can have in message windows :-) I am already considering adding that feature for the next version of Kopete; there are no technical or technological problems preventing it. However, there may not be time to implement it before KDE3.4.

It's an option I'm considering, for sure. But the current contact list code is quite flexible - flexible enough to allow me to throw together a drag-and-drop style editor for it, at least. This needs more discussion before anything gets coded. I think many people would be interested in showing this. Maybe an option could be added (if enought demand) to disable it. Fixed in trunk (SVN commit 946606) will be in KDE 4.3, in trunk user can define contact list layout so you can hide the icons or change order.

29,A bug for indentation was filed which was later reported to be a new feature rather than a bug. The report was made about out of indentation phrases which should be aligned with the line above it rather than the positive indentation scheme followed by kate. The requested behaviour was that of align section in which the entire section selected gets aligned with respect to itself. A suggestion to try using 'Clean Indentation' was made for aligning misaligned blocks. This requirement was then found to be present in the cvs which did the alignment of the current line or the selected text using normal c/c++ conventions. It was found to work for expression in parenthesis but for arguments it was found to work with limited correctness. A suggestion to open another wishlist was made if this was a problem. It was pointed out that if there's no text in a line then it's not aligned which was later reported to be a feature.,"Version: (using KDE Devel)
Installed from: Compiled sources
identation itself works fine. But: let's see this example: hello1, hello2, hello3. If you go with the cursor to hello2 and press ctrl-i, hello2 is moved even further to the right. The right (and expected) behaviour is that hello should be moved to the left so it is right under hello1.  (compare it with the behaviour of tab in xemacs). In my eyes, this really needs to be fixed. Thanks!!! Martin oh dear, the formatting is lost. Imagine, that hello2 is moved a bit to the right, like a \\t in front of it. Martin Hmm, why would hello2 move left? Are you saying it should align itself to the 'closest' tab boundary? So if you had a tabspace of 8 characters and you had ........hello, ...........hello2. Ctrl-I on hello2 should move it left because it's only 3 away from the left boundary but 5 away from the right one? For Kate, ctrl-I semantics have always been to unconditionally insert a 'positive' indent. Positive meaning to the right. This is a bug wrt other editors ..., hi, hello2 should be moved to the left, because it is not aligned with the line above. Martin, Martin Kbele 2003-10-25 09:30:53 ------- let me try it again: let's say we have the code something
{
.......hello1();
..........hello2();
.......hello3();
}
if you go now with the cursor in the line of hello2, hello2 should be moved to the left, because
1.) identation is about +8 spaces in a block, beginning from the opening parentheses (amount of spaces depends on your configuration of course).
2.) hello1 specifies where the block shall be aligned.
Right, so you are looking for an 'Align' action. This is more of a 'wishlist' since Kate doesn't really have this (see below). It has unconditional indent left and right. If you want hello2 to move left go to Tools and hit 'Unindent' which will move it left to the tab stop. If you 'Indent' it will move to position 16, the next tab stop to the right. You can alternatively try 'Clean Indentation' and see if that aligns the misaligned blocks of code for you. It will even out the misaligned blocks of code most of the time if it can. *** Bug 71479 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** *** Bug 75951 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** This is available in cvs.
Currently it works only if you use the 'cstyle' auto-indenter. The default shortcut is CTRL + TAB (controlled tab) and will align the current line OR the block of text you select according to normal c/c++ conventions. See also bug 40656 for further information and a warning. How does this work with things inside parenthesis, like parameter lists and conditionals? I'd like to have it as in emacs:
if ( foo == 1 &&
bar == 2 ) {
doit();
}
In this case the second condition should be aligned with the first one, not according to normal stuff. And parameter list handling like:
int foo(
int bar,
char *baz,
struct sizzle *gee
)
{..}
In this case the closing parenthesis should be aligned with the opening one. Yes, your first example works as expected. Your second example kinda works right now. Parameter lists are aligned just like you expect but it needs a reference character in the 'int foo (' line to judge what col to align to after that. Also, closing parenthesis are not aligned with the opening one. If this is really a problem for you, open up another wishlist item with appropriate examples. great, thanks a lot!! there is one little bug though:
. foo();
. bar();
if your cursor is in the line between foo() and bar(), in the line where no tabs are made yet and you press now the shortcut for the new align, the cursor just won't move under foo(). but the rest of it works very nicely! Thanks guys! Maybe re-open this bug since I think the feature is incomplete, but I can open a new bugreport about this. Thanks, With regards to the foo-bar problem, this was intentional. I didn't want to indent empty lines as that would leave quite a bit of useless leading spaces when selecting large regions and hitting Align -- it's also MUCH slower if I do not skip these lines when formatting an entire document. I guess I could make it so that's only the case when you're aligning a _block_ of text though -- I'll see what I can do. I cannot get this feature work. Is this working on kde4 beta2?

30,"This is a request for a new button that swaps between x and 1/x (portrait/landscape) orientation of selection rectangles in GIMP. The use case scenario is one where the user selects and entire image and scales the selection rectangle to maintain the aspect ratio, but then wishes to switch from portrait to landscape orientation or vice versa. This feature was implemented in trunk.","It would be usefull to add a \""Swap\"" button to quickly change the aspect ratio between portrait and landscape. This is needed when extracting a portrait from a landscape photo. Since there is no sign that this is going to happen for 2.4, I am bumping the target to Future. *** Bug 355694 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** I'm going to reset this to 2.4 because I expect to implement this very soon. An easier and much faster user interface: swap between portrait and landscape based on mouse movement. You already have to move the mouse to make your selection. You'll likely do something that is approximately the right ratio. If that's closer to portrait, then portrait should get used, otherwise landscape should get used. Another way to explain this: When the user makes the selection, select landscape mode if the horizontal mouse movement is greater than the vertical mouse movement, otherwise select portrait mode. That's one less confusing button occupying screen space. That's one less button to press. You can work faster, with less hand/finger/wrist pain. Albert, you completely misunderstood this. The point is being able to flip the aspect ratio after you have created your rectangle selection. Really? I found Alberts comment spot on. It basically would eliminate the need for this kind of button, since both x and 1/x would work equivalently in the GUI. I don't see much point in being able to flip the aspect *after* the creation of the rectangle. The placement of the resulting rectangle would need readjusting anyways (what is the fixed point of the rectangle while flipping?) and it sounds much more natural to me to be able to switch the orientation on-the-fly while creating the rectangle. I'm the reporter of the wish. Sven is right, I meant that it would be usefull to have the swap option after the creation of the rectangle selection. I do it \""by hand\"" often in that case : I've a landscape photo that contains an interesting flower for example. I want to print a photo that have the same proportions as the original, but in a portrait format, more adapted to my flower.
1. I first \""take a shhot of the aspect ratio\"" by selecting all the original landscape photo.
2. I freeze the aspect ratio (with the appropriate checkbox)
3. I shrink the rectangle to permit him to be rotated by 90
4. I \""rotate\"" him by taking my calculator, and calculating 1/[aspect ratio], and putting it by hand
5. I've now a perfect portrait zone wich I can adapt freely to my flower; and I'm happy :)
I don't know if adding a toolButton just to do it is a problem, but I really think I'm not the only one to do that sort of cropping on a photo. Thanks for interest ! Bruno, I agree that Albert's idea makes sense. Have gimp assume a landscape or portrait orientation automatically depending on whether the rectangular area swept out by the user is wider or higher. This might only be problematic when the aspect ratio was nearly, but not exactly square, but even here the user could control the proper aspect by exaggerating the motion in the larger of the two directions. If a swap button is maintained as in 2.3.12, then register the initial point used to sweep out the rectangular area and use that as the anchor rather than the upper-left corner as is now used. It is very likely that the first point selected by the user will be a desired point and this will not be the upper-left corner unless this happens to be where they started. As I stated elsewhere, it would also be great if the aspect ratio was automatically set to the initial aspect of the image being loaded. You might provide a \""lock\"" button to force the current aspect ratio to be retained upon subsequent loading of images for those times when someone wants to crop a series of pictures to the same proportions. Maybe the current Fix button could be a toggle that switched between \""Lock\"" (lock the aspect ratio - current behavior) \""Set\"" (automatically set the aspect ratio for each new image and then locks it) \""Auto\""(the Set behavior combined with the behavior suggested by Albert) or \""None\"". Having said this, I do appreciate having a toggle button at all. Thanks. Making this depend on the user's mouse action is not discoverable. There wouldn't be any way for the user to find out how to swap the aspect ratio. No way. It might make sense to determine the initial aspect ratio this way. But there still needs to be a button to swap it. Comment #7 is exactly the usage scenario for this. This is now implemented in trunk and seems to work reasonably well. Closing as FIXED.

It's more convenient to have a single history window that doesn't take up screen real estate than having to open the history in whichever window I'm currently browsing. I like the CTRL-B and CTRL-H features of Mozilla and would like that carried over. I know bug 178199 discusses CTRL-B (WONTFIX but perhaps CTRL-SHIFT-B) in particular but I'm talking about depending on the side bar at all. I really hate sidebars and would want to be able to disable them in place of these windows before I would migrate to Firefox. Since the roadmap is now to focus on the standalone apps with \""a conservative,sustaining engineering fashion\"" type of support for Mozilla/SeaMonkey, I think a \""SeaMonkey Parity\"" of some form should be established. Thanks. Reproducible: Always Steps to Reproduce: A bookmark manager window already exists, and bug 178199 covers giving it a better keyboard shortcut than Alt,B,M. I don't see a bug for adding a history window. how about something like about:history? similar to about:config - just a full page tree with a search/filter field at the top.

you wouldn't really need a menu or toolbar buttons like with the bookmarks manager.

but like the bm and unlike the sidebar, it would have all the sortable columns: name, url, last visited, first visited, number of visits, etc. it would be the \""power-user\"" supplement to the simple history sidebar. sure, the sidebar needs a few things fixed like searching urls, but other than that, i think it's fine for most uses - exactly what sidebars are for - a quick way to access something without leaving/obscuring the current page. and an about:history page would nicely fill in the gap left on the advanced end. a whole new history window is probably overkill, and a page could just as easily be opened in its own window or in a tab. while i'm brainstorming, you could probably even add a search shortcut ability so you could type something like about:history?extensions to open the history page and filter pages with \""extensions.\"" compare:
chrome://browser/content/history/history-panel.xul chrome://browser/content/bookmarks/bookmarksPanel.xul
chrome://browser/content/bookmarks/bookmarksManager.xul
about:config, reporter, not sure if you're asking for a whole new history window, or just the ability to open the sidebar history in its own window. if the latter is the case, then just open the above chrome url in a new window. the component and other fields probably need to be updated.
I'm really looking for two things:
1. A separate window so I can keep going back to the same window and open multiple windows from this window. chrome://browser/content/history/history-panel.xul would meet this need.
2. Being able to see and sort the history.
Seamonkey offers tabs for Title, Location, Last Visited, First Visited, Hostname, Referrer, and Visit Count. Not all of this is needed but at least the first four are helpful. Plus, I'd like to be able to open this easily, such as with /-\\H. Please add the Mozilla history window in Firefox! I think this is just one of the things that's missing in inferior browsers like Microsoft Internet Explorer. The Mozilla history window is just perfect!

I'm amazed that there is no way of knowing what the url or date of a history entry is. Mozilla history was excellent since you could re-trace your browsing using the timestamp and find collections of pages you'd visited. History (in life and browsing) is more useful when there is a context. Shouldn't there be an option to see when and what order a page was visited?

This patch checks to see if the KURLs are identical before attempting to copy. This is the same logic as used elsewhere in the modified file, so it was chosen to keep convention. However, it still suffers from a problem: if the KURLs point at the same location but have different string paths, for example /home/user/music/artist/song.mp3 and /home/user/music/artist//song.mp3, the test will fail. Therefore, this patch needs only a fix for this comparison problem, and then it should be ready to be applied. Jason, you can use KUrl::cleanPath() to fix this.

Donenfeld &lt;Jason@zx2c4.com&gt; \""KIO::file_copy\""ing with the src and dest the same will erase the file, so this patch checks to see if the KUrls are identical, after cleaning the urls, before attempting to copy. Since Max is the author who wrote the Collection code (including copying/moving), I'm going to wait for his approval to this patch before committing, lest we make an oversight. Sebr - sounds good. I can commit it myself, hopefully, because I should have svn commit access soon enough.  (sysadmins are usually pretty fast, no?) I can't test this at the moment, but I've got a couple of comments after reading the bug report and the patch: I didn't look up the api documentation, but using KIO::file_copy with the same source and destination url sounds like a bug in kdelibs. And I don't think that that is actually happening. Because you are moving from the filebrowser, SqlCollectionLocation doesn't notice that it's dealing with a file already in the collection, and therefore doesn't use the special code that stops it from removing files from the source collection.
I am a bit surprised that the patch even works (does it?). CollectionLocation should be removing the source files (because you are *moving* files) after the copy operation, which is probably when your files actually are deleted. Max, This was my initial thought too... that really the problem was that it was removing the source after moving. But then I fully mapped the flow, and I saw that that section never even gets called if sourceLocation = 0 (if it's coming from a file and not another collection). The logic for that part works fine, with m_tracksRemovedByDestination being correctly populated and processed. The thing is that removal code is never called when sourceLocation = 0. Generally copying or moving a file into itself will delete the file; I've seen this behavior in other languages and commands, and kio doesn't appear to be an exception. The patch does in fact work. Something still may be suspicious, though. Jason, are you sure that FileCollectionLocation::removeTrack does not get called? I just checked the code which starts the move operation in the filebrowser, and it creates a FileColelctionLocation. Therefore sourceLocation will always be 0, the file will be copied (and deleting a file whehn copying or moving it onto itself *is* a bug), and *CollectionLocation* will call removeTrack on the source location as part of its workflow. Aaaaa hah! With job never being assigned, slotJobFinished is never called, and if slotJobFinished is never called, slotCopyOperationFinished is never called, and if slotCopyOperationFinished is never called, slotFinishCopy is never called, and if slotFinishCopy is never called, removeSourceTracks is never called, and if removeSourceTracks is never called, remove is never called, and if remove is never called, QFile::remove is never called. This shouldn't happen though. While this works, you're right: there is something screwy going on. Why doesn't slotCopyOperationFinished get called independently of slotJobFinished? Or is it supposed to work this way? no, slotCopyOperationFinished should be called if we don't actually have to copy any tracks. That's a bug. Ok. I see how it all works now. New patch coming soon. Created an attachment (id=28094) [details] adds movedByDestination to CollectionLocation, ignoredDestinations was removed, as this was no longer pertinent, since it was only used in the flow from a job event. movedByDestination was added to collectionLocation, since this is something all collectionlocations will potentially need to account for. slotCopyOperationFinished is now called if no job is created. Since m_removeSources is now protected and part of CollectionLocation, collections that cannot move but only copy will just set m_removeSources to false in their constructor. If you like this, I'm able to commit myself now. But I'm guessing you'll have suggestions. I should probably make the map private and just add another protected accessor function. If we go this route, I should also make the protected accessor functions virtual and add proper comment documentation. SVN commit 876841 by jdonenfeld: This prevents deleting a song when moving it or organizing it into its original path name by making sure the source and destination are different before [re]moving. This functionality is also potentially extended to all CollectionLocations, as now the base class has public functions to keep track of such things. This also cleans up the logic and flow quite a bit.

I also noticed this warning in Session.cpp's Session::sendSignal() function: #warning \""TODO: Send the right signal here, QProcess::kill() always sends SIGKILL\"" I blindly tried to replace _shellProcess-&gt;kill() with _shellProcess-&gt;terminate(), but that did not help, so I gave up :) Maybe this even not that piece of code that causes the problem (although seems quite related). Maybe you'll have some further ideas. And I wasn't able to reproduce this bug on my machine at work, although both home and work machines run Debian/testing (but have different hardware). I'm puzzled what can cause this :) But while it's reproducable here, at home, I can test your ideas if any. &gt; I also noticed this warning in Session.cpp's Session::sendSignal() function: That is only called at the end of the terminal session to kill the main shell process. Otherwise Konsole doesn't touch any processes directly - it just sends the key presses you enter to the terminal. &gt; although both home and work machines run Debian/testing In other words, they have the same versions of all common software? &gt; (but have different hardware) Do they use the same type of CPU? I don't suppose it could be a 32bit / 64bit difference? Ah, no, seems unrelated :) How about this:
void Pty::lockPty(bool lock)
{
#warning \""TODO: Support for locking the Pty\""
//if (lock)
//suspend();
//else
//resume();
}
Not sure if this is it too... &gt; In other words, they have the same versions of all common software? Well, currently not, because I forgot that I updated home machine to debian/sid, but I recall that I was seeing this bug before I upgraded. Mmmm... not 100% sure though. 90% ;) &gt; Do they use the same type of CPU? &gt; I don't suppose it could be a 32bit / 64bit difference? Yep. Both use intel core duo &gt; Not sure if this is it too... No, that is called when Ctrl+S or Ctrl+Q is pressed. Can you try changing the interrupt key sequence to something else and see if it makes any difference. For example, change the interrupt key to Ctrl+Y stty intr /-\\Y Then try strace, sleep, make etc. but use Ctrl+Y instead of Ctrl+C to kill them. Chatting with ossi bringed up another very interesting usecase: Fact: ctrl-c doesn't work in console Next step: launch xterm and launch strace -ttt -o konsole.trace konsole nofork Now in that started konsole app, 'make' breaks just ok! Wonders :), strace fixes things :). After changing /-\\C to be /-\\Y situation is the same for /-\\Y as it was for /-\\C: e.g. /-\\Y breaks 'strace', but not 'make' &gt; strace fixes things :), You're doing two things there though, running Konsole with strace and also with the --nofork argument. To be sure which was making a difference, you'd need to:
1. Run \""konsole --nofork\"" (without strace) and see if the problem is still there.
2. Start Konsole normally (with no arguments), then attach to it with strace (using strace -ttt -p &lt;pid of konsole&gt;) and see if the problem is still there.
The problem disappears for me with both 1 and 2, while changing the interrupt sequence has no effect just like Dmitry reported. Any idea where to look in the code, where to set breakpoints, etc...? Fixed by SVN commit #771570. \""Fix Ctrl+C not killing applications on some users' systems. Reset all signal handlers to the default (SIG_DFL) in the child process after forking\""

35,"When a new activity is added, only the new activity is shown. After rooming in then rooming out, both activities can be shown. However, dragging around the old activity does not work, the place of the old activity jump to another place, and the place of the new activity seems arbitrary.  In addition, switching activity also makes the view jump suddenly to another place. Since the operations of adding activity and rooming out are useful, the above problems should be solved.","Version: (using Devel)
Installed from: Compiled sources
OS: Linux
Using nightly builds from project Neon, kdebase version 20080617+svn821478-0neon1 There seem to be some problems with the zoom out view. It doesn't layout the activities properly.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Zoom out.
2. Add Activity. Now only the newly added activity is shown, in the top left corner of the screen.
3. Zoom in.
4. Zoom out.
Now both the activities are shown, but not in the order they were added, and there is some whitespace around them. If another activity is added, this happens again, and have to zoom in and out twice to get all 3 activities to show.  Same here at openSUSE, KDE 4.1 beta 2. I'm using NVidia binary drivers btw, have an NVidia Geforce 6600 GT. Just found out that the \""offset\"" of the activity overview changes when you double click on the second activity. The same probably happens too when adding an activity. At this point, it's not possible anymore to use drag&drop to move to the first activity. Only zooming out, selecting the first, and zooming in fixes it. yeah, that regression crept in a while ago, and it's been bugging me a lot. we've actually got multiple bugs in this report, it'd be nice to separate them out (but I have to leave in a minute).
1) adding/switching activity makes the view jump suddenly to another place (it's trying to make sure the activity is visible, and being stupid about it)
2) dragging the view around to see other activities no longer works (regression! it worked before woc)
Actually, dragging around the view does work here *except right after adding an activity*. I just didn't know about that functionality when I filed this report. Adding an activity makes the view jump to another place, and also the placement of the new activity seems arbitrary. Bug = Add activity focuses view on the new activity until zoom level changes well then, let's make the title a bit clearer. I think add activity option (and zoom out) should be removed in the 4.1 final. This bug is quite big, plus there's no clear way to delete an activity. Also,performance when zoomed out is slow as hell. I didn't report this issues because some of them are already reported and I thought others are pretty obvious. Don't get me wrong, it's a great idea, but it's current status makes it confusing, useless and buggy :S performace is fine for me. are you using nvidia? there are already people making use of multiple activities, we're not going to take that away from them. it'd be really really nice if this bug could be fixed somehow, though. &gt; This bug is quite big, so huge it crashes your machine, loses dat, etc, right? this is a molehill, stop making it into a mountain. &gt; but it's current status makes it confusing, useless and buggy so don't use it. we have gotten many reports of people who DO like it and are using it for day to day work. i suppose your desire to see this set of problems hidden overrides their productivity? and if we'd taken this approach in 4.0 we'd be even further behind. SVN commit 838477 by chani: when a new activity is added, don't move more than necessary to show it this seems to fix dragging the view around too :) BUG: 164545, please backport.

36,"Moving files within Amarok inappropriately causes a dialog to be opened for each file under certain conditions. The following options must be selected to reproduce the behaviour: (1) Ignore \""the\"" in artist names, (2) Group by file type, (3) Replace spaces with underscores/restrict to ASCII, (4) VFAT safe filenames, (5) Overwrite destination. A bug fix was added whereby boolean logic was corrected to avoid showing progress info when overwriting tracks during a collection copy.","Version: (using KDE 4.1.2)
Installed from: Compiled From Sources
Amarok version 1.94
When moving a large amount of files to my collection, amarok2 opens a file dialog for every single file that it moves. To reproduce: Make a directory where you would like your music collection to be stored. Go in to amarok2 and set it up so that the new collection area is included. Then, right-click on local collection, select organise and select the new destination for the files. Even my Core 2 Duo with 2 GB of RAM could not handle 16,000 file dialogs, and crashed my whole system hard, requiring a reboot. Can we please either:
1) move the files sequentially, or
2) not display a file dialog?
Sorry, I can't reproduce this. I just tried, and there is information shown in the progress bar and nowhere else. I'm copying tracks to my local sql collection. I assume you are doing the same? Are you using Amarok to move the files? It still opens a file dialog for every file that it is \""organising\"" I just checked again. I have the following options ticked on in the Organise files option. Use cover art for folder icons Ignore \""the\"" in artist names. Group by file type Replace spaces with underscores. restrict to ASCII, VFAT safe filenames, Overwrite destination It might be that one of those options trigger this, or the combination. Weird. Once I started messing around with what is ticked, the problem went away. Now I am also unable to reproduce it. I have been able to reliably reproduce the bug. Use the files tab of amarok, then click on the directory that you want to move the files from, select move to collection. Select the following: Use cover art for folder icons. Ignore \""the\"" in artist names, Group by file type Replace spaces with underscores restrict to ASCII VFAT safe filenames Overwrite destination It makes lots of file transfer windows for me, every time. -Evert- I still can't reproduce this. Are you using copying using Amarok's filebrowser, or are you organising the collection browser? How did you install amarok (compiled, packages etc) and which platform are you using. I am using Amarok's file browser. I think so, anyways. I click on the files tab. I have noticed that I only get the lots of file moving dialogs if I have all of those options ticked. Right now I am moving my files in to my collection with Overwrite destination unticked and I do not get the file dialogs then. I downloaded the source of amarok 1.94, and compiled it with gcc . I am using Sorcerer Linux, so all software on my system is hand-optimized and locally compiled. -Evert- SVN commit 881542 by seb: Fix boolean logic which caused the progress info to be shown when overwriting tracks during a collection copy.
